## ‚≠ê About the project

![screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104617518/167607552-44354081-c7d7-4f65-bc25-fca4aec65967.png)

Ryax is an open-source platform that streamlines the design, deployment, and
monitoring of Cloud automations and APIs.

## ‚öô Built With

The code:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [dependency-injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/index.html)
- [SQLalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org)
- [GRPC](https://grpc.io/)

Around the code:

- [Nix](nixos.org/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)

Deploying Ryax:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

## Getting started with Ryax

We describe here two possible ways to install Ryax.

**On your local machine** : We recommend this option if you wish to test our
product with a minimal amount of configuration steps. You will have to install
a few dependencies.

**On a Kubernetes cluster** : This is the standard and recommended approach. We
recommend this option if you have an available cluster on your hands or if you
want a longer lasting installation for your production needs.

### On a local machine

// TODO we have nix-shell for all the dependencies, but we need to fix it.

You will need the following dependencies :

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (Or `nix-shell`, although poetry is
  substantially faster)
- [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)

Once these are available on your machine, follow these steps to run a local
Ryax instance.

- Clone [ryax-adm](https://gitlab.com/ryax-tech/ryax/ryax-adm/) somewhere and
  `cd` into it.
- Run `poetry install` to generate a virtual environment for python.
- Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment. These last two steps
  can also be replaced by `nix-shell`, although this one can take a while.
- Run `./adm/local_ryax/local-ryax.sh`. This will deploy a Ryax instance on
  your machine with `kind`.
- Connect to `localhost` on your navigator and *voil√†*.

**/!\ Warning** Kind runs a kubernetes instance in a docker container on your
machine, which will expose the NodePorts of the cluster. This may conflict with
ports that would be already used on your machine.

TODO write how to know which ports are exposed. (Or test a conflict situation)

### On an existing kube cluster

#### Preparatory steps

- Make sure you're on the intended cluster : `kubectl config current-context`
- Make sure it's empty : we offer no guarantee that Ryax will run smoothly
  alongside other applications.
- Make sure you have got complete admin access to the cluster. Try to run
  `kubectl auth can-i create ns` or `kubectl auth can-i create pc`, for
  instance.

We will assume that you are comfortable with Kubernetes and therefore we will
not provide too many details on the Kubernetes parts of the installation. If
not, you can just copy paste the commands and leave the default values as they
are.

#### Customize your installation

Installing Ryax is very much analogous to installing a Helm chart. To get
you started we will use a default configuration and tweak one thing or two
so that everything is compatible with your kube provider, but be assured
that you will be able to fine tune your installation later on.

Just like helm charts, we call "values" the configuration of a Ryax
cluster. Let's initialize a basic values file.

// TODO make the docker image public with a 'latest' tag
// TODO is this really more convenient than running at home in a nix-shell?
```{bash}
docker run -v $PWD:/data/volume -u $UID registry-1.ryax.org/dev/ryax-adm:staging init --values volume/ryax_values.yaml
vim ryax_values.yaml # Or your favorite text editor
```

The `clusterName` value is the name you give to your cluster, which is used in
various places. One of those places is the url of your cluster that will end up
being \<clusterName\>.\<domainName\>.io, therefore it has to be consistent with your dns.

// TODO sensible defaults for the values file.
// TODO add a 'domain' value so the user can use its own domain, instead of 'ryax.io'

The rest of the values is self explanatory, feel free to make them suit your
needs. We recommend that you start small with the volumes sizes, as you can't
shrink them later on without deleting them, which will force you to
backup/restore your data. The default values give comfortable volume sizes to
start working on the platform, you can always scale them later.

#### Install Ryax

Once you have customized your values, install Ryax on your cluster :

```{bash}
docker run -v $PWD:/data/volume -u $UID registry-1.ryax.org/dev/ryax-adm:staging apply --values volume/ryax_values.yaml
```

If the installation fails, check the logs, check your configuration and try
again. If you are lost you can contact us and we will be happy to help! <TODO
links to the various ways to contact us>

#### Configure your dns

The very last step is configuring your dns so that you can connect to your
cluster. The address you should register is \<clusterName\>.\<domainName\>.ryax.io.

To retrieve the external IP of your cluster, run this one liner
```
kubectl -n kube-system get svc traefik -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}'
```

If you want something easier to type day to day : `kubectl -n kube-system get
svc traefik`, under "External IP".
